# CMS-evaluation-paper

This repo contains the data and scripts used to create the primary and supplemental figures in "Evaluation of Conditional Mean Spectra Code Criteria for Ground Motion Selection" by T. J. Bassman, K. Zhong, and J. W. Baker, paper in preparation.

Prior to running the two figure-generation scripts, ```Ground_Motion.zip``` and ```Analysis_Results.zip``` should be unzipped and their directories saved in the same location.
