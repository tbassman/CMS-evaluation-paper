# CMS-evaluation-paper

This repo contains the data and scripts used to create the primary and supplemental figures in the pre-print "Evaluation of Conditional Mean Spectra Code Criteria for Ground Motion Selection" by T. J. Bassman, K. Zhong, and J. W. Baker.

Prior to running Matlab scripts, <Ground_Motion.zip> and <Analysis_Results.zip> should be unzipped and the resulting directories stored in the same location as the two .m files.
