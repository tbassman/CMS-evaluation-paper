# CMS-evaluation-paper

This repo contains the data and scripts used to create the primary and supplemental figures in the pre-print "Evaluation of Conditional Mean Spectra Code Criteria for Ground Motion Selection" by T. J. Bassman, K. Zhong, and J. W. Baker.

Prior to running the Matlab scripts, ```Ground_Motion.zip``` and ```Analysis_Results.zip``` should be unzipped and the two eponymous directories saved in the same location as the two .m files.
