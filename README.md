# CMS-evaluation-paper

This repo contains the data and scripts used to create the primary and supplemental plotted figures in "Evaluation of Conditional Mean Spectra Code Criteria for Ground Motion Selection" by T. J. Bassman, K. Zhong, and J. W. Baker, paper in preparation.

Prior to running, ```Ground_Motion.zip``` and ```Analysis_Results.zip``` should be unzipped, and the ```Ground_Motion``` and ```Analysis_Results``` directories saved in the same location as the .m files.

Inquiries may be directed to tbassman at alumni (dot) stanford (dot) edu.
